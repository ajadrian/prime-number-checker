# prime-number-checker
Checks a range of numbers and outputs a list of numbers and whether they are prime or not

Short, easy little program that takes the users input for range and outputs a list of numbers and if they're prime or not to a text file.
Each number is separated by a new line.

Using it is simple. After the program is run, you enter the lower range for your search. Say you want to know what numbers between 1 and 10,000 are prime. The first number you enter would be 1, and the second would be 10,000.
